# CryptoClustering
This project highlights the following technical skills:
* Data Exploration
* Data Preprocessing: Scaling Data
* Unsupervised Machine Learning: K-means
* Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis
* Data Analysis and Interpretation
* Data Visualization

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to use unsupervised machine learning to cluster cryptocurrencies based on their market data. 

### Data
Dataset of cryptocurrency price changes.
Data were accessed accessed November 07, 2023. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC. 

The data provided included the price changes at the following time intervals:
* 24 hours* 7 days
* 14 days
* 30 days
* 60 days
* 200 days
* 1 year

### Technologies Used
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* HV Plot
* SK Learn: Standard Scalar, Kmeans, and PCA

## Results
The elbow curve showed that the optimum number of clusters for this dataset is 4. The elbow curves were identical before and after PCA.

Before PCA, the cluster were not very distinct.

After PCA, the clusters were much more separated and distinct.

  * **Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

  * **Answer:** The elbow curves were identical. The clusters are tighter when using fewer features in the principal component analysis, as it combines all the features of the original data into just three features. We are able to see the differences between the points more easily.
